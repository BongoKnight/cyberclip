
# Introduction 

> Cyberclip is designed to detect and extract recognizable data from text inputs, enabling data transformation and enrichment for cybersecurity professionals. Tailored for cyber threat analysts and SOC operators, Cyberclip helps investigate and pivot around technical indicators such as domains, URLs, IP addresses, and file hashes. It features a simple terminal interface (TUI) that integrates with tools like UrlScan, OpenCTI, and VirusTotal. It can also be used to extract data from JSON, defang IoCs, and encode or decode data in formats like Hex, Base64, and URL encode and much more... In short, Cyberclip empowers investigators to perform quick checks and make informed decisions during investigations!
